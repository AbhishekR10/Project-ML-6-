Data Collection: Obtain weather data from reliable sources such as meteorological agencies, weather APIs, or historical weather databases. Collect data on various meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure.
Data Preprocessing: Cleanse the weather data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Perform data transformations if necessary, such as converting timestamps to datetime objects and extracting relevant features from the data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the weather dataset to gain insights into the distribution and relationships between different meteorological variables. Visualize the data using plots such as line charts, histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to identify patterns and trends.
Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the weather dataset that may influence weather predictions. This could include features such as seasonality, time of day, and geographical location. Use domain knowledge and statistical techniques to create new features that capture important weather patterns.
Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning models for weather prediction based on the problem type (e.g., regression for continuous variables like temperature or classification for categorical variables like weather conditions). Common models to consider include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks.
Model Training: Train the selected models on the weather dataset using the historical weather data. Split the dataset into training and testing sets using techniques like cross-validation or time-based splitting to ensure robust model evaluation.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, R-squared, or accuracy (for classification tasks). Compare the performance of different models to select the best-performing one for weather prediction.
